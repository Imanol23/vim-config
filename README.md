# Introduction

In this project all the files associated to my NeoVim and VIM setup will be stored.

## Installed Plugins

### Package manager

As the popularly known [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) project is currently unmainteined,
it was decided to use the [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager instead, as is is the most
stable and maintained plugin manager for Nvim.

At this point, the Lazy plugin manager is being used on default mode.

### Color Scheme

The [kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) color scheme has been choosed in this configuration,
more concretely we are using `colorscheme kanagawa-dragon` colors.
