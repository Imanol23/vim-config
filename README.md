# Introduction

In this project, all the files associated with my NeoVim and VIM setup will be stored.

## Installed Plugins

### Package manager

As the popularly known [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) project is currently unmaintained,
it was decided to use the [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager instead, as is the most
stable and maintained plugin manager for Nvim.

At this point, the Lazy plugin manager is being used in default mode.

### Tree Sitter

The [nvim-treesitter.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) parser has been installed. It provides
support for LUA, C, C++, Python and Markdown.

### Telescope

For fuzzy search on a repository/project, the [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) plugin
will be used.

### Color Scheme

The [kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) color scheme has been chosen in this configuration,
more concretely we are using `colorscheme kanagawa-dragon` colors.
